          With Domino's it is always “Rishton ka time”. Whether it's a treat for
          your promotion, a kid topping his class or winning the heart of your
          wife who is too tired to cook after a long day at work! A cheesy slice
          of the best pizza is all one needs to put things into perspective and
          start any celebration. Plus, you do not even need to rush to the
          restaurant to have one now. A call, a few clicks on our website or a
          few touches on the mobile screen is all you have to do to have that
          tempting, light-on-the-pocket pizza at your doorstep.

          No matter what the situation, pizza always helps. Especially a pizza
          that gives you the freedom to choose your toppings - from paneer,
          crisp capsicum, onion, grilled mushroom, golden corn, black olives,
          fresh tomato, red paprika, jalapeno, paneer tikka and extra cheese to
          non-veg toppings such as pepper barbeque chicken, peri-peri chicken,
          grilled chicken rasher, chicken sausage or chicken tikka- the options
          are almost endless, anything and everything you can think of that too
          on top of the crust of your choice - New hand-tossed crust, wheat thin
          crust, cheese burst crust, classic hand-tossed crust or a fresh pan
          pizza. Because just like a pizza, Domino's understands you.

          So stop googling for the “pizza shops near me” and order from your
          nearest pizza outlet to have a hot box of pizza on your table in the
          next 30 minutes, or berth at the next halting station.
